# Morse-code-using-ESP8266
This is a project which includes the use of an ESP8266 which was incorporated with the BLYNK application. When a user input is given it processes it and gives the morse code version on a LED and an LCD .We can also add a buzzer so that as the led blinks the buzzer goes off simultaneously in that rhythm.
